# gRPC Service on Golang #
---

## The general scheme of the project ‚Äî how authorization will work

### The characters:

**User** ‚Äî a person who is forced to log in because he wants to use our URL Shortener.
**URL Shortener** ‚Äî the service that will be the SSO client
**An authorization server (SSO)** is a service that can authorize, provide information about user rights, etc.

### How it will work:

The user (or the application used by him) sends a request to the SSO to receive a JWT authorization token
With this token, it goes to the URL Shortener to perform various useful queries ‚Äî create short links, delete them, etc.
The URL Shortener receives a request from the client, extracts a token from it, by which it understands who came and what it is allowed to do.
